## 1. Introduction
> This section should provide an overview of the entire document

### 1.1 Document Purpose
Describe the purpose of the SDD and its intended audience.

### 1.2 Product Scope
<!-- TODO -->

## 2. Design
> This section is the body of the SDD and should detail the nature and approach of the design.

### 2.1 Selected Viewpoints
> A viewpoint defines the perspective from which a design view is taken. Each selected viewpoint should state what concerns it addresses and identify the visualization language(s) it uses to do so.

*Note from Dr. Fridge: Only include "viewpoints" that you choose to document. If one is not used, feel free to remove it or leave it blank.*

#### 2.1.1 Context
Helps describe the design subject as a black box. It can depict the subject in terms of offered services, actors, system boundaries, and design subject's scope. Example visualization languages include UML use case diagram.

#### 2.1.2 Composition
Describes the way the design subject is (recursively) structured into constituent subsystems and (pluggable) components, buy vs. build, reuse of components. Can be broken down into Logical and Physical composition viewpoints. Example visualization languages include UML package diagram, UML component diagram, UML deployment diagram.

#### 2.1.3 Logical
Describes static structure such as classes, interfaces, and their relationships. Example visualization languages include UML class diagram, and UML object diagram.

#### 2.1.4 Dependency
Interconnection, sharing, and parameterization
